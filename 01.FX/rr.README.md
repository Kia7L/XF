Just Place '.fx' "FILE" In Root of 'C:\' & The '.gz' Archive...
That Should Be OK... Its Seems To Work Nearly The Same as In 'C:\Windows\C:\Windows\System32\etc.'
This Is Perfered Because If You Dont Know What Your Doing... Things Could Go Wrong And Break... Or Be Junk... For You...
Try To Have Less FX Versions Or Multiple Additions... 
This Is A Hazard To Your Settings On The Computer..
You Would Have To Utilize The file One At A Time With Each exe.

ALLSO A WARNING...ALLSO A WARNING...ALLSO A WARNING...

Things Could Go Wrong If edited Wrong... People Could Catch On fire or electricuted or worse explode...
The Chances Are If Your Smart And Proceed with Caution... You Should Be Safer... If You Dont, You Probobly Jumped Up Too Much On settings...

Also Currently You Have To Go To 'REG' "FOLDER" and install 
'.File.100' needed Properties... Because I've Updated It and Trying A New Version...
